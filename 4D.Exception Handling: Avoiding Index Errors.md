# 4D.Exception Handling in Python: Avoiding Index Errors

##  Aim
To write a Python program that handles an **IndexError** when trying to access an element beyond the available range of a list.

##  Algorithm
1. Define a list `list1` with some integer elements.
2. Use a **try-except** block:
   - In the `try` block, attempt to access an index that is out of range (e.g., `list1[5]`).
   - In the `except` block, catch the error and print a custom message `"You're out of list range"`.
3. Print the result based on whether the index access succeeds or fails.

##  Program
```
my_list = [10, 20, 30, 40, 50]
try:
    print(my_list[10])
except IndexError:
    print("You're out of list range")
```

## Output
<img width="449" height="95" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b802e3cf-6fbe-4ba2-ab2b-bec2ab1358ea" />


## Result
Thus the program executed successfully.
